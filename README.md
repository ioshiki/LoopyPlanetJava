# LoopyPlanetJava

This is the Java version of my project.

Building on the knowledge I applied onto my C# version,
I am applying more concepts I was not able to apply such as try-catch for versatility
and also used arrays to store the Planet String names and their multipliers.

This saves a lot of time as I no longer need to create an entire nested switch statement inside a while loop
and simply just reference back the menuchoice-1 to point to retrieve the correct values in the array index.
